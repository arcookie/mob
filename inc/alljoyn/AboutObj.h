     * The AboutObj class is responsible for transmitting information about the
     * interfaces that are available for other applications to use. It also
     * provides application specific information that is contained in the
     * AboutDataListener class
     *
     * It also provides means for applications to respond to certain requests
     * concerning the interfaces.
     *
     * By default the org.alljoyn.About interface is excluded from the list of
     * announced interfaces. Since simply receiving the announce signal tells
     * the client that the service implements the org.alljoyn.About interface.
     * There are some legacy applications that expect the org.alljoyn.About
     * interface to be part of the announcement. Changing the isAnnounced flag
     * from UNANNOUNCED, its default, to ANNOUNCED will cause the org.alljoyn.About
     * interface to be part of the announce signal. Unless your application is
     * talking with a legacy application that expects the org.alljoyn.About
     * interface to be part of the announce signal it is best to leave the
     * isAnnounced to use its default value.
