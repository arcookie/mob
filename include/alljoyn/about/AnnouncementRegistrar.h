class AnnouncementRegistrar {

  public:
    /**
     * Registers a handler to receive the org.alljoyn.about Announce signal.
     *
     * The handler is only called if all the interfaces are implemented.
     * For example, if the handler should be called if both "com.example.Audio"
     * <em>and</em> "com.example.Video" are implemented then call
     * addAnnouncementHandler once:
     * @code
     * const char* interfaces[] = {"com.example.Audio", "com.example.Video"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, interfaces,
     *                         sizeof(interfaces) / sizeof(interfaces[0]));
     * @endcode
     *
     * If the handler should be called if "com.example.Audio" <em>or</em>
     * "com.example.Video" is implemented then call
     * addAnnouncementHandler multiple times:
     * @code
     * const char* audioInterface[] = {"com.example.Audio"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, audioInterface,
     *                         sizeof(audioInterface) / sizeof(audioInterface[0]));
     * const char* videoInterface[] = {"com.example.Video"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, videoInterface,
     *                         sizeof(videoInterface) / sizeof(videoInterface[0]));
     * @endcode
     *
     * The interface name may be a prefix followed by a `*`.  Using
     * this, the example above could be written as:
     * @code
     * const char* exampleInterface[] = {"com.example.*"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, exampleInterface,
     *                         sizeof(exampleInterface) / sizeof(exampleInterface[0]));
     * @endcode
     *
     * The handler will receive any announcement that implements an interface
     * beginning with the "com.example." name.
     *
     * If RegisterAnnounceHandler is called with lists of interfaces that overlap
     * then multiple Announcements will be occur.
     * For example given the following
     *
     * * @code
     * const char* audioInterface[] = {"com.example.Audio"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, audioInterface,
     *                         sizeof(audioInterface) / sizeof(audioInterface[0]));
     * const char* audioVideoInterface[] = {"com.example.Audio", "com.example.Video"};
     * RegisterAnnounceHandler(busAttachment, handler, audioVideoInterface,
     *                         sizeof(audioVideoInterface) / sizeof(audioVideoInterface[0]));
     * @endcode
     *
     * If a BusAttachment is found that implements both `com.example.Audio`  and
     * interface `com.example.Video` the announce handler will be called twice.
     * Once for the first registration that is looking for `com.example.Audio` and
     * again for the second registration that is looking for both audio and video
     * interfaces.
     *
     * If the same handler is used for for multiple interfaces then it is the
     * handlers responsibility to parse through the reported interfaces to
     * figure out what should be done in response to the Announce signal.
     *
     * Note: specifying NULL for the implementsInterfaces parameter could have
     * significant impact on network performance and should be avoided unless
     * its known that all announcements are needed.
