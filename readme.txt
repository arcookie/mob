
This project is needed alljoyn SDK(for windows, alljoyn-15.04.00b-win7x86vs2013-sdk).

Because of sizes of those libraries, I couldn't upload those to this repository.

You could download it on https://allseenalliance.org/framework/download at v15.04

In the zip file you could download, there are two kind of libraries, debug, release.

alljoyn-15.04.00b-win7x86vs2013-sdk/alljoyn-15.04.00b-win7x86vs2013-sdk-dbg
alljoyn-15.04.00b-win7x86vs2013-sdk/alljoyn-15.04.00b-win7x86vs2013-sdk-rel

To compile sample project you need to copy lib files to {root}/lib/debug, and {root}/lib/release for each.
